# Questions for guest speakers

Jordan: Are licenses something that you need a lawyer for? Is there a default system for data/code protection built into github?

Sean: What is the role of personal privacy in licensing and protecting your project data?
      If we're taking data from someone who republished the data publicly, do we need to contact the republisher? The original publisher? What if we can't?
      Are there types of projects for which you wouldn't need to respect licenses? (I'm thinking of how IRB's often aren't required for findings that aren't "for generalizable knowledge".)

Joey: It seems like even if you collect data yourself, there can still be a reasonable argument as to why it is not yours (i.e., tweets aren't yours, webpages aren't yours, etc.). At what point are we allowed to claim our data as our own property?
